                developer fond of
                new technologies and open source.
                I have always enjoyed programming and computers in general, It has always fascinated me and that
                led me to exploring the amazing word of computer science.
                My will helped my a lot through my hard journey and I was able to quickly gain knowledge and
                experience in many fields.
                I am now proud to say that I am a Java Android developer, a Python and Flask master, a C and C#
                passionate, an Arduino enthusiast
                and a web developer embracing new technologies and advancements.

                It all started on a friday
                evening in my local library when I saw that book, "master programming in 1 month" was its title.
                It was written in french and it really taught me not only the basics of programming but also the
                building
                blocks of computer science. I still remember my self trying so hard to understand all of these new
                terms and concepts. I didn't speak english really good and that time and it was almost
                impossible to find tutorials in my native language so that book was my only source of information at
                that time. By the time I finished the book and it was a true challenge, I have gotten my basics
                and I wanted to learn more and to expand my knowledge. So I moved on to learning game development
                with
                Unity and C# and I started discovering forums, StackOverflow and the awesome community of developers
                on the net. And that my fellow readers is how this awesome journey started and believe me I am still
                at
                the beginning.</p>

            <p class="project-des">Pox is the biggest project I have worked on. It's basically a chat app that has
                location at the core of its functionalities. It lets you share
                current location, places, paths and also has a special feature to share quick fast messages.</p>

            <p class="project">Dummi</p>
            <p class="project-des">Dummi is basically an AI chat bot that learns from the people it talks to. The more
                users talk it has
                the better it gets at answering questions and maintaining a conversation. It has quite a small
                database for the moment but it's growing.</p>

            <p class="project-des">Free time is a set of python scrips I develop in my free time. It's really only for
                fun but it has
                many useful scripts like one that censors curse words in real time on Windows or another one that lets
                you use your
                phone as a numpad.</p>

            <p class="project-des">Don't pop it is a Unity game I have developed in my early days of programming. The
                game goal is,
                depending on the mode, either to avoid popping balloons or to pop as much in 30s. It's one of my first
                serious
                projects so I had to put it here.</p>
